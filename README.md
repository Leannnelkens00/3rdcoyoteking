To: S. N.

you gave me a bracelet and fixed it with your lighter.
you told me you remembered B and my dog Mia from 10 years ago.
you told me to go get my house and picked up a black rock off of the ground an dhamded it to me
i'm still so far from understanding it all but i think ive figured out that you are not an angel and you might be my friend from 2009 from S. D.
i probably am screweing stuff up as i type but I need help. I don't know what to do but i got something really big that needs to be solved from something else. it is all getting connected though
i might be in danger from greedy people and it all is way too big for me to solve and I need your help plz.
i just ended up stealing a canoe and traveling miles by myself in the middle of the night in a lake with a literal lake monster, not to mention man-bear-pigs, wolf men, humans and such
i cant ask for help anywhere else as people are mostly evil amd its only a rare person that actively seeks to fight the impulse to act on greed.
i need to talk to you. my number is 250-575-1854
i recovered my phone but not my laptop after an epic 3 day journey by myself through mountain terrain. i did make friends with a clan of Sasquatch (the People) which was nice. Now I have access to some of this but im still such a illiterate, i will not be able to find out how to get my blackrock house in time. my son is still kidnappped and i am on the verge of being put away in an institution or worse by my family, mostly over my dads murder and the trust fund. 
i dont really have anyone or anything except this undying belief that somehow i am connected to something more important than myself and i have responsibilities and fated to do something still. for such a time as this, pehaps. i realize comtacting you like this is ridiculous amd inappropriate and I dont think i care as i know this is probably the best chance of you getting this message. 

your friend
